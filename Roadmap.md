Of course. Here is an extensive backend roadmap for a three-person team to develop the AI-powered FRA Atlas and Decision Support System. This roadmap focuses exclusively on the backend architecture, data processing, AI model development, and API creation, assuming a separate frontend team will handle all user interface and visualization aspects.

### Team Roles & Responsibilities

To ensure parallel progress and clear ownership, the three backend developers will be assigned specialized roles:

1.  **Dev 1 (Lead & Data Architect):** Responsible for the overall system architecture, database design (SQL and NoSQL), data ingestion pipelines, geospatial data management, and final deployment. This role is the central point of integration.
2.  **Dev 2 (AI/ML Specialist):** Responsible for developing, training, and deploying all machine learning models. This includes the OCR/NER pipeline for document digitization and the Computer Vision models for satellite asset mapping.
3.  **Dev 3 (API & DSS Specialist):** Responsible for developing all RESTful APIs for the frontend, implementing the business logic for the Decision Support System (DSS), and managing user authentication and authorization.

### Project Roadmap: A Phased Approach

This project can be broken down into five distinct phases.

#### **Phase 0: Foundation & Architecture (Weeks 1-3)**

The goal of this phase is to set up the entire development environment and define the core architecture before any code is written.

* **All Developers:**
    * Collaborate on finalizing the technology stack.
    * Set up the Git repository with branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow).
    * Establish coding standards and a documentation framework (e.g., Sphinx).
* **Dev 1 (Lead Architect):**
    * Design the high-level system architecture (e.g., microservices for AI processing vs. monolithic API server).
    * Design the initial `PostgreSQL`/`PostGIS` database schema. Key tables would include `States`, `Districts`, `Villages`, `PattaHolders`, `Claims` (with geometry fields), and `Assets`.
    * Set up the development, staging, and production environments using Docker Compose.
* **Dev 2 (AI/ML Specialist):**
    * Research and benchmark OCR and NER models for handling scanned government documents.
    * Source initial datasets: sample FRA documents for digitization and high-resolution satellite imagery for the target states.
* **Dev 3 (API & DSS Specialist):**
    * Define the initial API specification using OpenAPI (Swagger). This contract will guide frontend development.
    * Set up the basic FastAPI/Django project structure with user authentication stubs.

---

#### **Phase 1: Data Ingestion & Digitization Core (Weeks 4-10)**

This phase focuses on the first major objective: digitizing legacy FRA records. This is a heavily data-centric and ML-intensive phase.

* **Dev 1 (Lead Architect):**
    * Build the data ingestion pipeline. This pipeline will watch a storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3) for new scanned documents and trigger the digitization process.
    * Implement asynchronous task handling using Celery to pass documents to the AI services.
    * Refine the database schema to store the structured output from the OCR/NER models.
* **Dev 2 (AI/ML Specialist):**
    * **Task 1 (OCR):** Develop a robust OCR service. This service will take a scanned document image and convert it into raw text. Fine-tune a model like Tesseract on sample documents if needed.
    * **Task 2 (NER):** Build the Named Entity Recognition model. This model will parse the raw text from the OCR service to extract key entities: `village_name`, `patta_holder_name`, `coordinates`, `claim_status`, `area_in_hectares`, etc.
    * Containerize the OCR/NER pipeline into a separate Docker service that can be called by Celery.
* **Dev 3 (API & DSS Specialist):**
    * Develop internal APIs for the pipeline to save the processed data into the `PostgreSQL` database.
    * Create the first set of read-only APIs for the frontend to fetch the digitized FRA claims and patta holder details (e.g., `/claims?village_id=X`).

---

#### **Phase 2: Geospatial Core & AI-Powered Asset Mapping (Weeks 11-18)**

This phase focuses on integrating spatial data and using Computer Vision to create the asset maps.

* **Dev 1 (Lead Architect):**
    * Write scripts to import foundational geospatial data: shapefiles for state, district, and village boundaries.
    * Integrate external data layers: forest data, groundwater data, and infrastructure data (e.g., from PM Gati Shakti portals) into `PostGIS`.
    * Develop a tile server or use a service like `pg_tileserv` to efficiently serve vector tiles ($MVT$) to the WebGIS frontend. This is critical for performance.
* **Dev 2 (AI/ML Specialist):**
    * Develop the Computer Vision models for asset mapping using high-resolution satellite imagery.
    * Train a multi-class supervised model (e.g., a U-Net, a type of Convolutional Neural Network or $\text{CNN}$) to identify and segment:
        * Agricultural land
        * Water bodies (ponds, streams)
        * Homesteads
        * Forest cover
    * Create a post-processing pipeline (implemented in `cv_models/inference.py`) to convert the model's raster output (pixel masks) into vector polygons (`GeoJSON`/`WKT` format) and calculate their area.
    * Containerize this CV pipeline using `cv_models/Dockerfile` and define it as an asynchronous Celery task in `cv_models/celery_tasks.py`.
* **Dev 3 (API & DSS Specialist):**
    * Develop geospatial query APIs that the frontend can use. Examples:
        * `GET /api/assets?bbox={coordinates}`: Fetch all mapped assets within a given bounding box.
        * `GET /api/villages/{id}/summary`: Provide a socio-economic and asset summary for a village.
        * `GET /api/layers`: List all available data layers (IFR, CR, assets, infrastructure) for the frontend to display.

---

#### **Phase 3: The Decision Support System (DSS) (Weeks 19-24)**

With all the data in place, this phase focuses on building the DSS engine to provide actionable insights.

* **Dev 1 (Lead Architect):**
    * Work with Dev 3 to optimize complex database queries needed for the DSS. This might involve creating materialized views for performance.
* **Dev 2 (AI/ML Specialist):**
    * Explore AI enhancements for the DSS. For example, build a clustering model (`K-Means`) to group villages based on their asset profiles (e.g., "high forest resource, low water access"). These clusters can be used for targeted policy-making.
* **Dev 3 (API & DSS Specialist):**
    * **Task 1 (Rule Engine):** Codify the eligibility rules for Central Sector Schemes (CSS) like PM-KISAN, Jal Jeevan Mission, MGNREGA, and DAJGUA. This is the core of the rule-based DSS.
    * **Task 2 (DSS Logic):** Build the DSS engine that takes a `patta_holder_id` or `village_id` and cross-references their data (land type, assets, water index) against the CSS rules.
    * **Task 3 (DSS API):** Create the primary DSS endpoint:
        * `POST /api/dss/recommendations`
        * **Input:** `{ "type": "village", "id": 123 }`
        * **Output:** A prioritized list of recommended schemes with justifications (e.g., "Recommend Jal Jeevan Mission: borewell intervention due to low groundwater index and high number of farms.").

#### **Phase 4: Integration, Testing, and Deployment (Weeks 25-28)**

This phase is about ensuring everything works together seamlessly, is well-documented, and is ready for production.

* **All Developers:**
    * Conduct thorough end-to-end integration testing.
    * Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for their respective components.
    * Participate in load testing the APIs to ensure they can handle expected traffic.
* **Dev 1 (Lead Architect):**
    * Finalize the production deployment architecture (e.g., using Kubernetes for scalability).
    * Set up monitoring, logging, and alerting (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack).
    * Perform the final deployment to the production server.
* **Dev 2 (AI/ML Specialist):**
    * Optimize the ML models for inference speed and resource consumption.
    * Document the accuracy and limitations of each model.
* **Dev 3 (API & DSS Specialist):**
    * Finalize and publish comprehensive API documentation for the frontend team.
    * Implement API rate limiting, security headers, and other best practices.

This roadmap provides a structured, parallel workflow for a three-person team, ensuring all backend components of this complex and impactful system are built robustly and efficiently.
